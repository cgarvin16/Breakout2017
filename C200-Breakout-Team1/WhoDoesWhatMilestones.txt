Problem log:
	issues creating a ball with a clear background; attempted cropping with various programs; ended up finding an online tool called lunapic where you can make part of an image transparent https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent -LF
	issues creating a ball object to use in file; bypassed for now by putting the ball's info in the main gameDisplay to focus on functionality aspects -LF
