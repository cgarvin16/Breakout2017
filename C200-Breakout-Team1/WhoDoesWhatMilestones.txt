	orig. ball file: https://pngtree.com/freepng/glass-ball_52804.html 
		resized and edited by Logan with paint 3D and https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent: ballNoBackground.png

Problem log:
	issues creating a ball with a clear background; attempted cropping with various programs; ended up finding an online tool called lunapic where you can make part of an image transparent https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent -LF
	issues creating a ball object to use in file; bypassed for now by putting the ball's info in the main gameDisplay to focus on functionality aspects -LF


Milestone 2:

–Add level progression – a minimum of five levels of increasing difficulty must
be included. Pause between levels and provide control to the user for resuming the next level.
	Date done:
	Prim. Person in Charge: Logan

-Images for all the functions ex) play, pause, lives, etc.
	Date done: 12/02
	Prim. Person in Charge: Carolyn

–Design and implement a score function that adheres to the game objective
(reach the top wall as quickly as possible). This MUST be documented in a
manner that completely captures how the score for your game is calculated.
	Date done:
	Prim. Person in Charge: Logan

–Add persistence for the top 10 high-scores/users in old-arcade style fashion:
1    AAA    10,500
2    AAZ    10,000
3    ZCV    850
Maintain the high-score information in a flat file that is loaded at game start-up.

	Date done: 12/02
	Prim. Person in Charge: Carolyn and Charles

–Add the score, number of lives, and a timer to the display.
